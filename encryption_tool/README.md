🔐 Simple Python Encryption Tool

This is a basic Python encryption tool that uses a randomized substitution cipher to encrypt messages.
Each character is replaced by a random corresponding character generated from a shuffled key, creating a simple but effective custom encryption.

✨ Features

Generates a unique random key for each run

Encrypts any message including letters, digits, punctuation, and spaces

Beginner-friendly and fully written in Python

Demonstrates foundational cryptography concepts

Simple command-line interface

🧠 How It Works

A list of characters (letters, digits, punctuation, and spaces) is created.

The list is shuffled randomly to create a key.

Each character in the user’s message is replaced with the corresponding character in the shuffled key.

The tool prints both the original and encrypted version of the message.

🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

python3 encryption.py


You’ll be asked to enter a message to encrypt.

💻 Example Output
Enter a message to encrypt: Hello World!
original message: Hello World!
encrypted message: S!f@P#=]pQx
